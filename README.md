# EKDIST
Explore idealised single channel records and fit many sorts of distributions (eg exponential pdf to dwell times, gaussian to amplitudes).

Idealisation of an experimental single channel record produces a list of durations and amplitudes of each single channel event (opening or shutting).  EKDIST package provides scripts/functions to view and/or fit these events.
